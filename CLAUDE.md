## Skills — Read These First

Before writing any UI code, editing any component, or reviewing any page:

1. **Load `skills/design-system/SKILL.md`** — mandatory before touching any UI file
2. **Load `skills/design-system/design-system.md`** — the full design contract

Before starting any feature, fix, or change:

3. **Load `skills/testing/SKILL.md`** — mandatory on every task, not just when asked

Before writing any animation, micro-interaction, hover state, or transition:

4. **Load `~/.claude/skills/emil-design-eng/SKILL.md`** — animation decision framework, easing curves, press states, popover origins, performance guardrails. Answers "should this animate?", "what easing?", "how fast?".

Before designing new UI components or doing any visual review/polish pass:

5. **Load `~/.claude/skills/taste/taste-skill/SKILL.md`** — bias-correction rules for layout, typography, interactive states, materiality, and empty states. See project overrides below before applying.

**Additional skills available on demand** (not auto-loaded — invoke explicitly when needed):
- `~/.claude/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` — deep brand+product design system; requires PRODUCT.md/DESIGN.md in project root
- `~/.claude/skills/taste/redesign-skill/SKILL.md` — full component redesigns
- `~/.claude/skills/taste/minimalist-skill/SKILL.md` — stripping components to essentials
- `~/.claude/skills/taste/soft-skill/SKILL.md` — soft/warm aesthetic polish

This is not optional. Every UI decision must be verified against the design system. Every feature must pass the testing checklist before being marked done.

### Project overrides for global design skills

The global skills have rules that conflict with Central's **intentional** design decisions. These project rules win:

| Global skill rule | Central override |
|---|---|
| `taste-skill` bans emojis entirely | Emojis **are used** for team icons (`🏛️`, `🎵`, etc.) — ban applies only to decorative prose/button-label use |
| `taste-skill` "Lila Ban" — no purple/AI aesthetics | Central's brand **is** regal plum (`#3E1540`, `#2D0F2E`) — the ban does not apply |
| `taste-skill` recommends Geist/Satoshi fonts | Central uses **Inter** (body) + **Instrument Serif** (display) — do not swap |
| `taste-skill` Tailwind v3 guards | Central runs **Tailwind v4** — ignore v3-specific warnings |

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # start dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build (also type-checks)
npm run lint     # ESLint
```

There are no unit tests. Verify features by running the dev server and testing manually.
Always run `npm run build` before considering any task complete — a passing build is required.

## Architecture

### Middleware
The auth middleware lives in `proxy.ts` — **not** `middleware.ts` (that file was deleted).
Public routes allowed through: `/`, `/landing`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/join`, `/onboarding`, `/ministries`, `/auth/`

### Multi-tenant model
Every workspace is a **ministry**. All tenant data carries a `ministry_id` FK. RLS policies enforce isolation. Two SECURITY DEFINER helpers bypass profile-table RLS without recursion:
- `auth_ministry_id()` — returns current user's `ministry_id`
- `auth_is_admin_or_leader()` — returns `true` if role is admin or leader

New users with no `ministry_id` are redirected to `/join` by middleware.

### Routing flow
/ → /home (root redirect)
/login, /signup → auth pages (no ministry required)
/join → invite code or register new ministry
/home → main app shell (requires auth + ministry_id)
/ministries → public ministry discovery
/onboarding → ministry registration wizard

### Tab structure (all in `home-app.tsx`)
HomeApp (root — owns all global state)
├── HomeTab           — greeting, role badge, up next event, recent chats
├── AnnouncementsTab  — full feed, RSVP, admin/leader CRUD
├── ChatsTab          — Church Chats / My Chats sub-tabs, search, unread badges
├── PlanTab           — team planning (Praise Team, Student Org Board, Small Groups)
├── DirectoryTab      — searchable member list, opens MemberSheet
├── JournalTab        — devotionals, prayers, verses
├── GivingTab         — Zelle info, editable by admins
└── ProfileTab        — spiritual profile fields, sign out

### Global state in HomeApp
- `activeTab` — which tab is visible
- `globalOpenChat` — mounts `ChatScreen` above everything when non-null
- `totalChatsUnread` — drives BottomNav badge
- `chatRefreshKey` — incremented on chat close to trigger refreshes
- `recentChats` — top 3 chats by latest message, kept live via Realtime
- `ministryId` — current user's ministry UUID, passed to all DB-writing components

### Supabase Realtime channels
| Channel | Table | Events | Consumer |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| `group-messages-{groupId}` | `messages` | INSERT | `ChatScreen` |
| `reactions-{groupId}` | `message_reactions` | INSERT, DELETE | `ChatScreen` |
| `home-app-recent-chats` | `messages` | INSERT | `HomeApp` |
| `read-receipts-{groupId}` | `group_members` | UPDATE | `ChatScreen` |

### Supabase project
- Project ID: `wgqpnilaokfipocsugqo`
- Storage buckets: `announcement-images` (public), `devotionals` (public), `profile-images` (needs public toggle), `worship-charts` (public)

## Environment Variables (required on Vercel)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Service role key (used in auth callback) |

## Database Schema

| Table | Key Columns |
|-------|-------------|
| `ministries` | `id`, `name`, `university`, `size`, `invite_code` (unique), `created_by`, `is_public` |
| `profiles` | `id`, `ministry_id`, `name`, `email`, `graduation_year`, `role`, `about_me`, `bible_verse`, `prayer_request`, `pray_for_me` |
| `groups` | `id`, `ministry_id`, `name`, `type` (`church`/`my`/`dm`), `created_by`, `archived` |
| `group_members` | `group_id`, `user_id`, `last_read_at` |
| `messages` | `id`, `group_id`, `sender_id`, `content`, `created_at`, `reply_to_id` |
| `message_reactions` | `id`, `message_id`, `user_id`, `emoji` — UNIQUE(message_id, user_id, emoji) |
| `announcements` | `id`, `ministry_id`, `title`, `body`, `is_pinned`, `is_event`, `image_url`, `audience`, `created_by`, `show_attendees` |
| `announcement_views` | `announcement_id`, `user_id` — UNIQUE |
| `rsvps` | `announcement_id`, `user_id` — UNIQUE(announcement_id, user_id) |
| `teams` | `id`, `ministry_id`, `name`, `description`, `icon`, `created_by` |
| `team_roles` | `id`, `team_id`, `name`, `permissions` (JSONB) |
| `team_members` | `id`, `team_id`, `user_id`, `role_id`, `added_by` — UNIQUE(team_id, user_id) |
| `worship_charts` | praise team chart uploads, OCR extracted data |
| `meeting_notes` | ministry meeting notes |

**Profile trigger:** `handle_new_user()` fires `AFTER INSERT ON auth.users` and auto-creates `profiles` row. `ministry_id` is NULL until user completes `/join`.

## Roles & Permissions

Four tiers — visitor, member, leader, admin. DB stores mixed casing; always check with `.toLowerCase()`.

| Feature | Visitor | Member | Leader | Admin |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| View announcements | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create/edit/delete announcements | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create church chats | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Create my/DM chats | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Archive/manage church chats | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View RSVP attendee list | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Toggle public attendee visibility | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Access Settings tab | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Change member roles | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Edit giving info | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Edit ministry profile | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

**Visitor:** People participating before formal membership — identical permissions to Member. Badge is white/outlined to distinguish from Member's filled cream badge.
**Leader subtypes:** DGL, Student Board, Praise Team — all share the leader permission tier.
**Admin subtypes:** Pastors, Deacons, Elders — all share the admin permission tier.

**Role check pattern:** Any check like `role === "member"` must be `["member", "visitor"].includes(role)`. Any check like `["admin", "leader", "member"].includes(role)` must add `"visitor"`.

---

## Critical Conventions

1. **Never use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`** — Supabase session only
2. **Role checks:** always `["admin", "leader"].includes(userRole.toLowerCase())`
3. **Optimistic updates** on all user-facing writes (messages, reactions, RSVPs)
4. **All DB writes** go through the browser Supabase client or server actions — no raw fetch
5. **Don't split `home-app.tsx`** — intentionally one file
6. **Tap vs long-press in ChatScreen:** < 400ms = emoji picker, ≥ 400ms = reply — never break this
7. **ministry_id on all writes:** every INSERT/UPDATE must include `.eq("ministry_id", ministryId)` — defense-in-depth on top of RLS
8. **SECURITY DEFINER helpers:** use `auth_ministry_id()` and `auth_is_admin_or_leader()` in RLS policies — never query `profiles` directly inside other table policies
9. **RSVP is a toggle:** one row per (user, announcement). Insert on first click, delete on second. Never allow duplicate RSVPs.
10. **Middleware is `proxy.ts`:** never recreate `middleware.ts` — it was intentionally deleted

## Layout Rules

- **Mobile container:** `max-w-[390px] mx-auto` — always, never full-width on mobile views
- **Full-screen overlays:** `fixed inset-0 z-[N]` outer wrapper
- **Overlay inner:** `max-w-[390px] mx-auto w-full h-full flex flex-col`
- **Safe area:** `pt-12` on all full-screen overlay headers (iOS status bar)
- **Scrollable pages:** `pb-28` to clear the bottom nav

## Database Migrations
Never create migration files in the `supabase/` folder and ask the user to run them manually. The Supabase MCP is connected — always run migrations directly against the database using the MCP. When a schema change is needed, execute it immediately as part of the task. After running, verify the tables and policies were created correctly by querying the database before moving on.
